## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is where I host most of the programming stuff I'm interested in. Currently, some code is also hosted at [CodeBerg.org](https://www.codeberg.org/jmizv).

The topics my projects are built on or for:

1) Music
   1) [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/killerblau)
   2) [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com/user/killerblau)
2) [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
3) [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game))

And most of the time they play with statistics.
