## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is where I host most of the programming stuff I'm interested in. Currently I'm trying to migrate to [CodeBerg.org](https://www.codeberg.org) as it is a non-profit community for hosting code but everyone only knows Github or GitLab...

The topics my projects are built on or for:

1) Music
   1) [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/killerblau)
   1) [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com/user/killerblau)
1) [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
1) [Skat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game))

And most of the time they play with statistics.

Some spying for my personal entertainment:
